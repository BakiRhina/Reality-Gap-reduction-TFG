# Enhancing MARL for Reality Gap reduction

Welcome to my Final Bachelor Project!

### Scope and Goals

This project is divided in two main parts, simulation and implementation. The goal is to apply some techniques to diminish the reality gap when transfering trained MARL (Multi-Agent RL) from the simulation to the real-world application.

### Simulation

Gazebo simulator (https://gazebosim.org/home) is used to cope with the simulation used in the paper "Distributed RL for Cooperative Multi-Robot Object Manipulation". Specifically, Gazebo Fortress due to its compatibility with ROS 2 Humble, for robot control.
