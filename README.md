# Enhancing MARL for Reality Gap reduction

Welcome to my Final Bachelor Project!

### Scope and Goals

This project is divided in two main parts, simulation and implementation. The goal is to apply some techniques to diminish the reality gap when transfering trained MARL (Multi-Agent RL) from the simulation to the real-world application.
